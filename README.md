Purescript School of Music
==========================

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is another attempt at porting the music notation part of the [Haskell School of Music](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2) (HSoM) to the browser. It follows an [abortive attempt in Elm](https://github.com/danigb/elm-school-of-music) in conjunction with danigb.  This failed largely because of the lack of type classes in Elm but also because of the time delays inherent in Elm's port system when requesting that a sound should actually be played.

Partly this project is about helping me to understand the differences between Purescript and Haskell.  But I am hopeful that at least we might be able to express pieces of music in the HSoM DSL and hear them playing in the browser.
