Mapping of HSoM instruments to Gleitzman instruments
====================================================

As can be seen drom the table below, there is very good correspondence between instruments recognized by HSoM and those with soundfonts on the Gleitzman web site.  For PSoM, it is probably a good idea to regularise the HSoM names in such a way that there is a straightforward translation in both directions between them and the Gleitzman names.  Those on the HSoM side without mappings will be ignored, those on the Gleitzman side with no correspondence can be added.

It is probable that FX1Train and the doubly-underscored lead_8_bass__lead are misprints.
